# Ride-Management-System
The Ride Management System (RMS) is a comprehensive application developed for a vehicle rental company, enabling users to book rides and avail goods transportation services. The system encompasses various aspects, including vehicle categorization, driver classification, and customer management.

The RMS class incorporates dynamic arrays for Drivers, Customers, Vehicles, and Services. It allows for the addition and removal of customers, drivers, and vehicles, providing a flexible and scalable platform. The program provides an intuitive menu-driven interface to ensure user-friendly interaction.

Key functionalities of the RMS include the ability to add new customers, manage drivers and vehicles, and print comprehensive lists of customers, drivers, and vehicles with their details. Additionally, the system facilitates the printing of service history for a particular vehicle, customer, or driver, along with options to view rankings, license information, and updated driver salaries.

The TMS supports service requests for rides or deliveries, presenting customers with a list of available vehicles and drivers based on their rankings. Fair calculations for services take into account factors such as distance, fuel type, driver experience, vehicle rankings, and additional features. The system also handles service cancellations, charging a cancellation fee, and updates the status of drivers and vehicles accordingly.

Advanced features of the RMS include the ability to print details of customers who used the same vehicle on different dates, list drivers who completed delivery services on the same days, and retrieve information about pending services or canceled services by customers.

The main program acts as a comprehensive test suite, covering all the functionalities of the RMS class. It utilizes files as a database to store and retrieve information for Services, Vehicles, Drivers, and Customers. Upon application launch, data is loaded from the files into the respective lists, and updated data is stored back in the files upon termination.

Overall, the Transport Management System provides a robust platform for efficient ride and goods transportation management, ensuring streamlined operations and improved customer experience for the vehicle rental company.
